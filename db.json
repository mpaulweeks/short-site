(Netherlands Film Festival)\nQuality storytelling, originality and personality of characters, great animation performance. (Festival Stop Motion Montréal)\nA film worth freezing for. (Anchorage International Film Festival, Alaska, USA)\n18 minutes of macabre delight, this short should be every child’s first horror experience (The Ink And Code)\nA brilliant stop-animated short giving a new spin on the zombie theme. (South African Horrorfest)\nThe attention to detail throughout the film is exquisite, it’s beautifully crafted and the story is brilliant and ingenious (…) I would love to see Under The Apple Tree developed into a feature film.
